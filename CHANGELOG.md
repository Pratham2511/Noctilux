# Changelog

## [1.2.3] — 2026-08-20

Terminal assistant response-flow and scope-handling fixes.

### Fixed

- Generated SQL is now correctly normalized from the backend `query` field,
  preserved as the latest executable SQL, and used by `/run`.
- The terminal no longer claims SQL is ready when no executable SQL was
  returned.
- Off-topic and unrelated prompts are handled separately, without fake
  confidence, SQL success, or `/run` guidance, and do not overwrite valid
  previously generated SQL.

### Improved

- Generated SQL is visibly displayed before execution guidance.
- Terminal states are clearer for SQL, informational, unrelated, and backend
  error responses.
- `/run` with unsupported arguments now explains that it executes the most
  recently generated SQL.
- README usage and scope documentation reflect the current terminal behavior.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-08-20

Gemini model retirement fix + documentation overhaul.

### Fixed — Gemini 404 "model no longer available"

- **Root cause:** the Gemini model was hardcoded as `gemini-2.5-flash` in three
  separate backend `_get_client` functions (`llm_service.py`,
  `intent_service.py`, `schema_creator_service.py`). Google retired that model
  for new users, so every Gemini call returned HTTP 404. The
  `verbis.llm.geminiModel` VS Code setting existed but was **never read by any
  code** — a dead setting — so users had no way to override the retired model.
- **Fix:** the default Gemini model is now `gemini-3.6-flash`, defined once as
  `DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL` in `llm_service.py` and shared by the other services.
  The `verbis.llm.geminiModel` / `verbis.llm.groqModel` settings are now read
  by the extension and forwarded per-request through `BackendClient` →
  `GenerateRequest.model` → the backend `_get_client`, so the configured model
  is the one actually sent to the provider. Verified: the exact model string
  reaching the Gemini API is `gemini-3.6-flash` by default and honors user
  overrides.

### Added — Retired-model detection with actionable errors

- The backend detects retired/unknown-model errors (provider 404, "no longer
  available", "not found", or a known-retired model name) and returns a clear
  `400` naming the configured model, why it failed, which setting to update
  (`verbis.llm.geminiModel`), and the supported default — instead of a raw
  provider 404. API keys are never included in the message.

### Added — Migration-safe warning for explicit retired settings

- If you have **explicitly** set `verbis.llm.geminiModel` to a retired model
  (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`), Verbis shows a one-time, non-destructive warning
  with an "Open Settings" action. Your setting is never overwritten — fresh
  installs simply default to `gemini-3.6-flash`.

### Changed — Documentation

- README rewritten to describe the **current** product (terminal assistant,
  slash commands, scope guard, credential choice, Text2Schema, configuration).
  Removed the accumulated "What's New in vX.Y.Z" running history and stale
  references (webview chat as the primary interface, `gemini-2.5-flash` as the
  default, retired commands). Version history now lives only in this
  CHANGELOG.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-19

Corrective patch release. v1.2.0 shipped several regressions; this release
fixes them and tightens security, scope enforcement, and UX.

### Fixed — Terminal could not reach the backend (HTTP 404 on every question)

- **Root cause:** FastAPI double-prefix. `generate.py` and `schema_create.py`
  declared absolute route paths (`/api/generate`, `/api/schema/create`) while
  `main.py` also mounted those routers with `prefix='/api'`, so the routes
  were registered at `/api/api/generate` and `/api/api/schema/create`. The
  client POSTs to `/api/generate` → `404 {"detail":"Not Found"}`.
- **Fix:** all route paths are now relative (`/generate`, `/schema/create`,
  …) and `schema_create` is mounted with `prefix='/api'` like every other
  router. Verified live: `/api/health`→200, `/api/generate`→route resolves,
  `/api/execute`→422 (validation), `/api/intent/cache/clear`→200,
  `/api/schema/create`→route resolves.

### Fixed — Raw JSON / cryptic errors shown to the user

- `BackendClient` now extracts FastAPI's `detail` field (string or validation
  array) instead of dumping the raw response body into the terminal.
- A `404` now produces an actionable message ("extension and backend may be
  out of sync — try Verbis: Restart Python Backend") instead of
  `HTTP 404: {"detail":"Not Found"}`.
- The backend now maps LLM client errors to clean HTTP errors: a missing or
  invalid API key returns `401` with "No valid API key for the selected
  provider. Run 'Verbis: Set API Key'…" instead of a bare
  `500 Internal Server Error`; rate limits return `429`.

### Added — Explicit API-key source choice (no silent consumption)

- The first time you ask a question in a session, if a configured key exists
  you now choose explicitly: **Use existing configured key**, **Use a
  different key for this session only**, or **Manage keys…**. Cancelling
  aborts the question — a stored key is never consumed silently.
- A session-specific key is held in memory only, never written to
  SecretStorage, and is discarded when the terminal closes or on `/reset`.
- `/status` now shows which credential source is active.

### Added — Deterministic SQL-only scope gate

- A deterministic pre-filter now runs before the LLM intent classifier.
  Obvious off-topic requests (jokes, poems, weather, recipes, trivia) are
  rejected instantly with a polite message and **zero API cost**; obvious
  database requests skip the classifier entirely. Ambiguous input still falls
  through to the existing few-shot LLM classifier, which fails open.
- Database signals win over off-topic keywords, so polysemous queries like
  "weather data from the sensors table" are correctly treated as in-scope.

### Fixed — Sidebar

- Removed stale `verbis.openChat` command references (the command no longer
  exists) — replaced with `verbis.openAssistant`. Clicking an empty-state
  item no longer throws "command not found".
- The Schema view no longer shows a perpetual "Backend starting…" spinner
  when the backend is stopped or crashed. It now shows an actionable
  "Backend not running — start" / "Backend crashed — restart" item that runs
  `Verbis: Restart Python Backend`; the spinner only appears while the
  backend is genuinely starting.
- Empty-state text updated from "open the chat" to "open the assistant".

### Fixed — Blank Activity Bar icon

- `media/sidebar.svg` used a solid teal fill with white text, which VS Code's
  Activity Bar masks to an invisible square. Rewritten as a monochrome
  `currentColor` glyph (database cylinder + query spark) so it themes
  correctly.

### Removed — Accidental Kimi (Moonshot) runtime integration

- v1.2.0 added Kimi as a runtime LLM provider by mistake. All runtime
  integration removed: the `kimi` provider branch in the backend LLM service,
  the `kimi_model` config field, the `kimi` provider enum and `kimiModel`
  setting in `package.json`, and Kimi key handling in `SecretsService` /
  `extension.ts`. Genuine providers (`gemini`, `groq`, `local`) are
  unchanged.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-19

### Changed — Terminal assistant replaces the webview chat (major UX change)

The conversational interface is now a **Claude Code–style REPL hosted in VS
Code's integrated terminal** (via the `Pseudoterminal` API), instead of a
React webview chat. The terminal is the primary and default way to talk to
Verbis.

- **New command `Verbis: Open Assistant`** (`Ctrl+Shift+Q`) opens the
  assistant terminal. Re-running it focuses the existing terminal rather
  than spawning duplicates.
- **Real terminal behavior:** live typing, cursor, backspace, Enter to send,
  Ctrl+C to cancel the in-flight request (or clear the line when idle).
- **Slash commands handled locally:** `/help` `/run` `/status` `/model`
  `/history` `/clear` `/reset` `/cancel` `/exit`. They never reach the
  backend.
- **One request at a time:** while the agent is working, further Enter
  presses are ignored with a notice; Ctrl+C cancels.
- **Conversation context preserved** per terminal via a stable `sessionId`
  forwarded to the backend on every turn; `/reset` starts a fresh session.
- **Generation vs. execution stay distinct:** the agent generates SQL;
  `/run` explicitly executes the last generated statement through the
  existing execution path (row limits, read-only guard, history logging).

### Added — Kimi (Moonshot AI) provider

- New `kimi` provider option routes through the existing provider
  abstraction to Moonshot AI's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (`https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`), defaulting to the **Kimi K3** model.
- Configurable via `verbis.llm.kimiModel`; API key stored in VS Code
  SecretStorage (`Verbis: Set API Key` → Kimi). Keys are never logged or
  persisted server-side.

### Architecture

- **`src/assistant/AssistantSession.ts`** (new) — UI-independent
  conversational controller. Owns session state, busy flag, and
  cancellation; delegates all SQL generation/execution to the existing
  `BackendClient` pipeline. No agent logic is duplicated in the UI layer.
- **`src/terminal/VerbisTerminal.ts`** (new) — the `Pseudoterminal` REPL:
  keystroke handling, output formatting, slash commands.
- **`src/terminal/TerminalManager.ts`** (new) — terminal lifecycle (create,
  reuse, cleanup).

### Removed — old chat from the main flow

- Removed the `verbis.chatView` sidebar webview and its `ChatViewProvider`.
- Removed the `Verbis: Open Chat` and `Verbis: Open Chat in Editor Panel`
  commands (the terminal supersedes them).
- Removed the chat tab and its components from the React webview
  (`ChatPanel`, `MessageBubble`, `SQLCodeBlock`, `ConfidenceBar`,
  `NarrativeCard`, `ResultTable`). The webview bundle remains for the
  schema / glossary / query-tree / connections panels.

Backend functionality, connection management, schema/history sidebar trees,
settings, and API-key commands are unchanged.

## [1.1.5] — 2026-08-19

### Added — Sidebar chat (Copilot-Chat-style)

- New `verbis.chatView` sidebar webview (`ChatViewProvider`, a
  `vscode.WebviewViewProvider`) inside the Verbis activity-bar container —
  the chat now opens next to your code like Copilot Chat / Cline instead of
  only as an editor tab.
- `Verbis: Open Chat` (`Ctrl+Shift+Q`) now focuses the sidebar chat view.
- The editor-tab chat panel is still available via the new
  `Verbis: Open Chat in Editor Panel` command.
- The sidebar chat shares the same React bundle and full message protocol
  (GENERATE_SQL, EXECUTE_SQL, glossary, Text2Schema, connections, backend
  status) as the editor panel.
- Connection selection (`verbis.selectConnection`, `verbis.addConnection`)
  now syncs the active connection + connection list to both chat hosts.

---

## [1.1.4] — 2026-08-19

### Fixed — Chat input invisible + connection form not saving

**Bug 1 (chat input):** The chat tab's message list and input row shared a
scrolling flex container without `min-h-0`, so the flex item refused to
shrink below its content height and the query text box was pushed out of
view — the chat panel opened with no visible place to type.

**Fix:** The chat tab now uses a dedicated non-scrolling flex column
(`min-h-0` on the messages area, `shrink-0` on the input row), and the
textarea / select / button carry explicit VS Code theme colors
(`--vscode-input-background`, `--vscode-button-background`, etc.) so they
render correctly regardless of Tailwind utility generation.

**Bug 2 (connection form):** The Connections tab form posted
`CONNECTION_FORM_SAVE` / `STORE_DB_PASSWORD` webview messages that had no
handler in `VerbisPanel` — saving a connection from the webview silently
did nothing.

**Fix:** `VerbisPanel` now handles both messages: connections are appended
to `.qmind/config.json` and passwords are stored in VS Code SecretStorage
(OS keychain). The new connection is auto-set as active.

### Added — Live connection list in chat

- New `GET_CONNECTIONS` / `CONNECTIONS_UPDATED` webview messages.
- The chat panel's database selector is now populated with real saved
  connections (instead of a hardcoded "Default DB") and stays in sync when
  connections are added via the command palette or the Connections tab.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed — Backend startup crashes + blank chat UI + empty sidebar

**Bug 1 (backend failed to start):** `services/llm_service.py` was missing
the `LLMRouter` class and `LLMResponse` dataclass that 6 modules import
(`api/dependencies.py`, `sql_generator`, `nosql_generator`,
`narrative_service`, `plan_explainer`, `federated_service`) — the backend
died at import time with `ImportError: cannot import name 'LLMRouter'`.

**Bug 2 (backend failed to start, round 2):** `models/requests.py` was
missing 8 model classes imported by `schema_impact`, `robustness_service`
and `glossary_service` (`BreakageEntry`, `ImpactResponse`,
`RobustnessQueryItem`, `PerturbationResult`, `RobustnessReport`,
`GlossaryTerm`, `JoinPath`, `GlossaryStore`).

**Bug 3 (blank chat panel):** `VerbisPanel` loaded
`webview/dist/assets/main.js` + `main.css`, but Vite emits `index.js` +
`index.css` — the script 404'd and React never mounted.

**Bug 4 (empty sidebar):** `package.json` declares `verbis.connections` /
`verbis.schema` / `verbis.history` views but no tree providers were
registered.

**Fix:**
- Added `LLMRouter` + `LLMResponse` to `llm_service.py` (never raises;
  errors land in `LLMResponse.error`; falls back Gemini → Groq → Ollama).
- Added the 8 missing Pydantic models to `models/requests.py`.
- `VerbisPanel.getHtml()` now loads the correct Vite asset filenames.
- New `src/views/SidebarProviders.ts` with `ConnectionsProvider`,
  `SchemaTreeProvider`, `HistoryProvider`, registered in `extension.ts`
  and refreshed when the backend becomes ready.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-08-18

### Chore

- Republished the v1.1.1 packaging fix to the VS Code Marketplace
  (no code changes beyond version bump).

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-08-17

### Fixed — Backend install failure on packaged extension

**Bug:** `uv failed (exit 2): error: File not found:
.python_backend/requirements.txt` — the extension's `.vscodeignore` was
excluding `python_backend/**` entirely, so when Verbis was installed from the
.vsix, none of the Python source files (`main.py`, `services/*.py`,
`api/routes/*.py`, `requirements.txt`) were present in the extension folder.
The `BackendInstaller` then failed because `requirements.txt` was missing.

**Fix:**
- Updated `.vscodeignore` to keep all `python_backend/` source files (they are
  required for the backend subprocess to run). Only exclude bulky/transient
  artifacts: `__pycache__/`, `venv/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`,
  `.ruff_cache/`.
- Added a pre-flight guard in `BackendInstaller.install()` that throws a clear,
  actionable error if `requirements.txt` is missing — instead of letting
  `uv` fail with a cryptic "File not found" message. The error message tells
  the user to reinstall from the Marketplace or report the issue.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added — Three Major Upgrades + 7 Critical Fixes (A-G)

#### Upgrade 1 — Few-Shot LLM Intent Guard with LRU Cache
- Replaced keyword-based intent classification with few-shot LLM prompting
- 15+ DATABASE examples and 15+ OFFTOPIC examples at temperature=0
- Correctly passes "weather data from sensors table" → DATABASE (context override)
- Correctly blocks "what is the weather today" → OFFTOPIC
- 200-entry LRU cache keyed on (message, provider) — repeated queries are free
- Cache stores full (intent, message) tuple — same off-topic query shows same response each time
- Fails open to DATABASE on any exception — never blocks a valid query

#### Upgrade 2 — Auto-Install Backend Dependencies (uv + globalStorageUri)
- BackendInstaller class auto-creates Python venv on first activation
- Venv stored in `context.globalStorageUri` — survives extension updates
- Uses `uv` for 10x faster installs (falls back to pip if uv unavailable)
- "Install Now / Later" dialog + progress notification
- `verbis.installBackend` command for manual re-installation
- Marker file (`verbis_ready`) skips install on subsequent activations
- Cross-platform Python path detection (Windows + Linux/Mac)
- Slim requirements.txt (~120MB, no PyTorch/spaCy/onnxruntime)

#### Upgrade 3 — Text2Schema (NL → Database Schema)
- New `python_backend/services/schema_creator_service.py` implementing arXiv 2503.23886
- Structured JSON intermediate format (tables, columns, relationships, indexes)
- Dialect-aware DDL generation (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite)
- Foreign keys emitted as TABLE-LEVEL CONSTRAINT clauses (portable across dialects)
- Mermaid ER diagram auto-generation
- Iterative refinement ("add a payments table" updates existing schema)
- New `/api/schema/create` and `/api/schema/refine` routes
- New `SchemaCreator.tsx` component with 3 stages: input → preview → done
- "Copy DDL" and "Download as .sql" buttons for user-friendliness
- "Create DB" tab added to webview

#### Fix A — cachetools added explicitly to requirements.txt
Verified that neither chromadb 1.5.9 nor openai directly requires cachetools.
Added `cachetools>=5.0.0` explicitly (20KB, eliminates silent crash risk).

#### Fix B — clear_intent_cache wired via /api/intent/cache/clear endpoint
- New POST endpoint `/api/intent/cache/clear`
- Called from `verbis.setApiKey` handler after storing new key
- Called from `verbis.clearApiKey` handler after deleting key
- Called on `verbis.llm.provider` configuration change (provider switch)

#### Fix C — Schema cache refreshed after SCHEMA_EXECUTE
- New POST endpoint `/api/schema/refresh` (Fix F)
- Deletes stale `schema_cache.json` + re-indexes ChromaDB
- Called after DDL execution so chat knows about new tables
- Wrapped in try/catch — non-fatal if refresh fails

#### Fix D — Full connection-selection flow
- `verbis.selectConnection` command with quick-pick UI
- `verbis.addConnection` auto-sets new connection as active
- `VerbisPanel.setActiveConnection()` + `resolveConnectionId()` helper
- Falls back to first connection in config.json if no active connection set
- SCHEMA_EXECUTE uses `resolveConnectionId()` — not hardcoded 'default'

#### Fix E — No floating promises in onDidChangeConfiguration
- Uses sync callback + explicit `.then(noop, errHandler)`
- Avoids eslint `no-floating-promises` warning
- Errors logged to `console.warn` instead of being silently swallowed

#### Fix F — /api/schema/refresh is a POST endpoint
- Cache invalidation is semantically a mutation
- POST is more robust than relying on requestJson's implicit GET-with-no-body behavior
- Takes JSON body `{ db_config_id: string }`

#### Fix G — Uses existing `id` variable in verbis.addConnection
- The handler already declares `const id = crypto.randomUUID()` (line 178)
- Used that exact variable name when calling `setActiveConnection(id)`
- Did not invent a new variable like `connectionId` or `newId`

### Changed
- Bumped version from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0
- BackendManager constructor now takes `pythonExe` as 4th parameter (from BackendInstaller)
- Removed `getPythonPath()` helper from BackendManager.ts (venv managed by BackendInstaller)
- Removed `fs` import from BackendManager.ts (no longer needed)
- `verbis.openQueryTree` command renamed to `verbis.openTree` (per spec)

### New Commands
- `Verbis: Install / Reinstall Backend` — Manually trigger backend setup
- `Verbis: Select Database Connection` — Quick-pick UI for switching connections

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/intent/cache/clear` — Clear intent classification cache
- `POST /api/schema/create` — Generate schema from NL description
- `POST /api/schema/refine` — Apply NL refinement to existing schema
- `POST /api/schema/refresh` — Force-refresh schema cache + ChromaDB index

### New Files
- `src/services/BackendInstaller.ts` — Auto-installer class
- `python_backend/services/schema_creator_service.py` — Text2Schema service
- `python_backend/api/routes/schema_create.py` — Schema creation routes
- `python_backend/requirements-optional.txt` — Heavy optional deps (PyTorch, spaCy)
- `webview/src/components/SchemaCreator.tsx` — Schema creation UI
