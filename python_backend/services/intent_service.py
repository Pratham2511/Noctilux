"""
Few-Shot LLM Intent Guard for Verbis — with LRU cache + invalidation.

Classifies whether a user message is database-related (DATABASE) or
off-topic (OFFTOPIC) using a single LLM call with explicit few-shot examples.

Why few-shot LLM (not embeddings, not keywords):
- Keyword lists: 30%+ false-positive rate on polysemous words
  ("weather data from sensors table" is a valid query but contains "weather")
- Embedding approach: requires 40 API calls at startup, fails if no API key
  set yet (first launch), doesn't work with Groq (no embeddings endpoint)
- Few-shot LLM: ~50 tokens per request, 95%+ accuracy, works with all providers,
  zero startup cost, no extra dependencies

Cache: 200-entry LRU keyed on (normalized_message, provider). Repeated
identical queries return cached result with zero API cost. The cached value
is the FULL (intent, message) tuple so the same off-topic query shows the
same polite response each time — avoids the "different message every reload"
UX bug. cachetools is added EXPLICITLY to requirements.txt (verified: neither
chromadb 1.5.9 nor openai directly requires it — do NOT rely on transitive deps).

Cache invalidation: clear_intent_cache() MUST be called when the user sets a
new API key, clears their API key, or switches LLM provider. Wired via the
/api/intent/cache/clear endpoint (see Task 1.2 + Task 1.4).

Research basis:
- Uber QueryGPT and Oracle Select AI use dedicated classification prompts
- arXiv fine-tuned sentence transformers paper notes softmax classifiers are
  over-confident on out-of-scope samples — explicit examples correct this
- VLDB 2025 AIDB Workshop: few-shot prompting is the production-standard
  intent scoping method for NL2SQL systems
